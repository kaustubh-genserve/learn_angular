    <img [src]="imagePath" [alt]="selectedUser.name" />
    <!-- string interpolation binding from ts to template -->
    <span>{{ selectedUser.name }}</span>
  </button>
</div>

<!-- While it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the <img> tag,
 you're actually NOT doing that.
 Instead, property binding targets the underlying DOM object property (which, in this case, also happens to be called src) and binds to that. -->
